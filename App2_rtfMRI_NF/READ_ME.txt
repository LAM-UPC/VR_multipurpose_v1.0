To run the software as it is, you only need the VR_NF_executable folder


To make modifications, you will need the VR_NF_source_code folder
If you wish to modify the application and recompile it, e.g. for different resolution, velocity changes etc, see the following:
- The script Script_Controll_app in relation to the movement of the avatar
- The folder Assets/PascualMaragall for the brain and introductory images used
- The script Script_crono_12sec_app in relation to the initial waiting time (currently 12 seconds)
- The script Script_gener_text_app in relation to the Results.txt file that gets generated at the end of a session.
